# UART based Registers

This is basic Verilog IP to add control registers for Design Verification Process using UART Interface

`uart_core.v` contains UART TX/RX, many of blocks are slightly modified IPs taken from [libfpga](https://github.com/Wren6991/libfpga/tree/master)

Main state-machine for Control registers will be added shortly
